# The Rise and Fall of Algorithmic Stablecoins (Series Blog - Part 1)

In this series blog we traverse the thrilling landscape of algorithmic stablecoins. In this series, I aim to introduce the layers of complexity within algorithmic stablecoins with a simple languahe, addressing past failures and exploring potential solutions. Keep up with me as we journey together through this cool sphere of cryptocurrency. 


Let's embark on a journey into the world of algorithmic stablecoins. These digital assets are ingeniously designed to remain pegged to a certain value, typically the US dollar. Brilliant, isn't it? However, it's not always a smooth sailing in this sphere.

Our first stop is the tale of **Basis**. This project was a trailblazer in the algorithmic stablecoin space, backed by a whopping $133 million from big-name investors. Despite its promising inception, Basis hit a roadblock in December 2018 before it could even truly begin. Regulatory constraints, due to the coin's structure, led to concerns that it might be classified as a security. Facing a sea of potential regulations, the Basis team decided to abort their mission.

Next, we make a pit stop at **Iron Finance's TITAN**. This algorithmic stablecoin made headlines in June 2021 following a shocking collapse. Picture TITAN's value nosediving from over $60 to near-zero within mere hours. This calamitous downfall was triggered by a panic sell-off following a period of immense growth and hype. This incident has been dubbed as the first large-scale crypto bank run.

Lastly, let's discuss **Empty Set Dollar (ESD)**. In December 2020, ESD struggled to maintain its peg. The reasons were multifaceted, one being the lack of sufficient incentives for users to purchase ESD when trading below its target price. This resulted in the coin languishing in a state of depegging longer than it should have.

What can we glean from these tales? While algorithmic stablecoins possess tremendous potential, they're also laden with risks ranging from regulatory hurdles to market dynamics and technical challenges. As we continue to navigate through this intriguing crypto terrain, let's remember to tread cautiously and do our due diligence.  

Stay tuned as we delve deeper into potential solutions and strategies to mitigate these risks in the forthcoming parts of this blog series. Until next time!
